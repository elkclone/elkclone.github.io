Putting it all together
To create a simple Blackjack card game using stacks in C, you will implement a deck of cards as a stack data structure
. A linked list is the ideal way to implement a dynamic stack in C, since it can grow and shrink as cards are dealt and played.
The game logic will involve shuffling the deck, dealing cards, and comparing the player's and dealer's hands. 
Core C functions
Stack implementation using a linked list
A stack in C can be implemented using a struct for a node and a pointer to the top of the stack. 

    struct Card: Represents a single card with its value.
    struct Node: Represents a node in the linked list, containing a Card and a pointer to the next node.
    struct Stack: The stack itself, with a pointer to the top node.
    push(): Adds a card to the top of the stack.
    pop(): Removes and returns the card from the top of the stack.
    isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty. 

Game logic using stacks
The overall game flow will use three stacks: one for the main deck, one for the player's hand, and one for the dealer's hand.

    Initialization: Create a 52-card deck and push the cards onto the deck stack.
    Shuffling: Randomize the deck stack by repeatedly popping all cards into a temporary array, shuffling the array, and pushing the
    cards back onto the stack.
    Dealing: Pop two cards from the deck stack and push them onto the player's and dealer's hand stacks.
    Gameplay loop:
        Prompt the player to "hit" (take another card from the deck stack) or "stand" (end their turn).
        Implement logic to handle aces (counting as 1 or 11) and determine hand totals.
    Conclusion: Compare the final hands to determine the winner, and print the result.
